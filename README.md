## About

SebasQueue is a super basic and easy to use queue plugin designed for anarchy and survival servers. This plugin is a fork of
PistonQueue because I just wanted to create my own, so a fork of the plugin was created
that is designed for everyone and has more updates and support.

## Features

### Tablist

An easy tablist without complex things.

### Server ping information and a custom protocol

### Custom Kick Messages

For example the "You have lost connection to the server" message you see on the server 2b2t.org and the other copies of 2b2t.

### Custom In-Server Offline Messages

Instead of showing an error saying the server is down you can customize this message to whatever message you want in the server.

Example:

`&6 YOURSERVERNAME is down`

### Auth server support

Auth server support for cracked (offline mode: false) servers. You can now have the authserver go first and then the
queue!

## Setup

Check out the wiki for a tutorial on how to setup SebasQueue, is the exact thing in PistonQueue, maybe adding some new features

If you find any bugs or ways to improve the plugin open a issue on github.
